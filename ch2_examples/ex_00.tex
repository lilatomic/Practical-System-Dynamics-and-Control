\section{Example}

\subsection{Statement}
Starting from the following block diagram:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Convert to SFG
	\item Write TF
	\item Convert to SSR
\end{itemize}

\subsection{SFG}
We begin with the SFG

This process is straightforward, and following the instructions will work out fine.

\subsection{SSR}
We find the SSR before finding the TF because the SSR allows us to use the intermediate variables. This allows us to delay having to solve directly for inputs.

We use the standard instructions for converting a block diagram to SSR:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Label State Variables
	
	\item Label variable derivatives
	
	\item Equate derivatives with values
	
	\item Construct Matrices
\end{itemize}

\subsection{TF}
\subsubsection{From SSR}
Once we have the SSR, we can easily convert to the TF by using the standard instructions.

\subsubsection{From Block Diagram}
Because the problem deals with a MIMO system, solving directly for the TF is annoying and difficult.

This will give us a system where the TFs are entangled. They can be solved, but honestly it's almost easier to just build the SSR and convert it.
